Subject: IMPORTANT Javascript task!

Hey team,

I think it would be awesome if all of our pages can respond
instantly without having to load an entire page of new HTML from
the server.

One of our engineers got a start at implementing AJAX to do
this and then took off for the rest of the week.

Can you take a look at our Customer Survey and finish passing the
data, making a request with it, and appending it to the page?

Thanks!!!
Mel
